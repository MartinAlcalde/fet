Assets for Functional Ear Training

- Source: Tone.js Salamander piano samples (public demo set).
- Delivery: samples are embedded as base64 data URIs in `assets/piano.base64.js`.
- Anchors included (pitch-shift covers the rest): A2, A3, A4, A5, C3, C4, C5, C6.

Notes
- Everything runs 100% local with `file://` — no CDN or HTTP server needed.
- `Tone.js` is vendored in `assets/lib/Tone.js`.
- The old raw MP3s and trimming script were removed; regeneration would require re‑adding sources and tooling.
