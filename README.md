3. **Master Exercise 3** (Full octave) - professional level recognition

## 🏆 Why Functional Harmony Training Works

**Traditional ear training** teaches you to recognize intervals (major 3rd, perfect 5th, etc.). **Functional training** teaches you to hear how notes *function* in real music.

When you hear a song, you don't think "that's a major 6th interval" - you think "that's the subdominant resolving to tonic." **That's functional hearing, and it's what separates amateur from professional musicians.**
